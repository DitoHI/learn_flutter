## Basic Learning Flutter

This project is based on site-learning in Udemy. Check out the link [here](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-flutter-app-development-course-for-android-ios/).
Flutter is a really amazing language. Though I must say I really love it because I come from the
background of __Java__ and __Kotlin__, but __Flutter__ combined with __Dart__ is something else.

## Prerequisites

- Full Supported IDE. I recommend using __Android Studio__
- Install Flutter SDK
- Run it
